# Indian-Law-LLM

## Overview
This project involves the use of a Language Model (LLM) to analyze crimes and determine the corresponding sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The model also provides procedures and recommendations based on the IPC.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with project walkthroughs and explanations.
- **src**: Source code for various components of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and utility functions.
- **docs**: Documentation and reports related to the project, including technical documentation and summarized reports.
- **presentations**: Slide decks used to present the project.
- **demos**: Links to demo videos or interactive demos showcasing the project.
- **blog_posts**: Articles and blog posts discussing the project in detail.

## Project Details
### Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop an AI-based tool that can:
1. Classify crimes based on their descriptions.
2. Identify the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that apply to the crime.
3. Provide procedures and recommendations based on the IPC.

### Methodology
#### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Collection**: The data used for this project consists of crime descriptions and their corresponding IPC sections. To protect privacy, synthetic or anonymized datasets are utilized.
- **Preprocessing**: The preprocessing phase involves cleaning and formatting the data to make it suitable for analysis by the LLM. This includes tokenization, normalization, and other text preprocessing techniques.

#### Model Training
- **Language Model**: A pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on the crime data to understand and classify the crime descriptions accurately.
- **Training Process**: The model is trained using a supervised learning approach, where it learns to map crime descriptions to the appropriate IPC sections. Various performance metrics are used to evaluate the model's accuracy and effectiveness.

#### Deployment
- **Application**: The trained model is integrated into an application that takes crime descriptions as input and provides the corresponding IPC sections, procedures, and recommendations as output. The application is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.

## Installation and Usage
Since the actual code cannot be shared, here is a general guide on how the project would be set up and used:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Indian-Law-IPC.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd LLM-Indian-Law-IPC
    ```
3. **Install the required dependencies** (dependencies would be listed in a `requirements.txt` file):
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the main application** (in a typical setup, you would run the application script):
    ```sh
    python src/app.py
    ```
